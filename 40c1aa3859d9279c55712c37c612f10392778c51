We recommend the filter quicken for it to avoid long times before a user gets to use the phone for the very first time. Note that if all applications in /system are already compiled with the quicken compiler filter or are compiled with the speed or speed-profile compiler filter, the pm.dexopt.first-boot has no effect.\n\nany reason not to follow that?",
